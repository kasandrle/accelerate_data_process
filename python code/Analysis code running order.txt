Python code to run:

1_Automated_RGA+TEY_analysis_grouping_new_oleg2025-06-29
 - Main data processing code. Starts from the experimental data. Slow, may take ~10-15 minutes per full sample holder

2_Extract experiment parameters and save in a file v3
 - Extracts from experimental data photodiode current etc. Compressing and saving as a .zip file results of RGA+TEY analysis. Relatively fast

3_Manipulations with TEY data
 - Replaced three codes below to analyze experimental TEY data and find maximal TEY values at t=0 (when EUV exposure starts). Fast. Substitutes programs below:
		+3. TEY raw data processing_spike removal
		+4. TEY averaging of normalized data v2
		+5. Search for Maximal TEY value

4_Manipulations with mass spectra
 - Replaced three codes below to process mass spectral data, generated by first code. Not fast - ~1min for whole folder, delay in the beginning - reading ~10,000 files. Substitutes programs below:
		+6. Merge time-dependent mass spectra
		+7. Averaging total outgassing signal v2
		+8. Renaming mass spectra

5_Sorting files plotting TEY v3
 - Organizing data in output folders - ascii and plots. also plots TEY data. Fast. Substitutes programs below:
		+5. Sorting files - ascii
		+6. Sorting files - plots
		+7. Plotting TEY
6_Cleanup v2
 - Deleting all not needed folders.


New file names:

XX_TEY_normalized.txt - time dependent TEY values

XX_TEY_normalized_averaged.txt - Averaged time dependent TEY values, if several measurement per sample were performed

TEY at t=0.txt - Maximal values of TEY around 60 seconds, when EUV exposure starts

XX_MS-time_merged.txt - merged time-dependent mass-spectra

XX_total_outgassing_averaged.txt - averaged signal of total time-dependent outgassing

XX_total_outgassing.txt - signal of total time-dependent outgassing for sample XX

XX_mass_spectrum_averaged.txt - mass spectra


Bernhard's file names:

_TEY_signal.txt - averaged TEY signal with standard deviation as function of time

_outgassing_data_mean_std.txt - averaged mass spectra with standard deviation (Mass_spectra)

_mass_xx_ion_signal.txt - Averaged time-dependent signal (averaged _mz_xx_corrected_signal files)

_mz_xx_corrected_signal.txt - individual time-dependent signal for m/z xx with subtracted baseline

_sum_corrected_signal.txt - total time-dependent outgassing for individual sample
